# 🗓️ Day 002 — June 9, 2025

## ✅ What I Did

### 👨‍💻 Professional Work

- Completed full 8-hour workday at MinoHealth AI Labs
  - Continued building bio-agent infrastructure

### 🤖 LLM Journey

- 7:00 PM – 10:45 PM:
  - Repeated and rebuilt the full LLM preprocessing pipeline again
  - Couldn’t begin attention mechanism as planned due to time constraints

### 🌙 Carryover Session (Technically early Day 003)

- 2:23 AM – 3:30 AM: dozed off after waking
- 3:30 AM – 6:45 AM: deep work session on attention mechanism
  - Studied:
    - The 4 Types of Attention Mechanisms
    - Why long sequences are hard to model
    - Encoders, decoders with RNNs
    - Limitations of RNNs
    - Soft attention (Bahdanau et al., 2014)
    - Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017)
    - Intuition and mechanics of self-attention

### 🙏 Spiritual Practice

- Spoke in tongues for 30 minutes
- Matthew Chapter 1

### 💪 Physical Discipline

- No physical training logged for the day

## 🧠 Reflections

The fight for consistency is real. Even though I didn’t hit all my goals for Day 2, I still put in work that carried into the next day. Every hour matters. Every minute compounds.

## 🔁 Adjustments

- Tomorrow's goal: Continue self-attention deep dive and begin coding attention from scratch
- Continue my reading list of books

## 🔮 Key Insight

Sometimes you don’t finish the plan—but if you stay in motion, _you don’t lose momentum_.
