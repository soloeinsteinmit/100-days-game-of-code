# 🗓️ Day 017 — June 24, 2025

## 🕰️ Time Log

- Slept: 9:03 PM
- Woke: 4:57 AM
- Note: Slept long due to physical fatigue from Day 15’s 3.1-mile run

## ✅ What I Did

### 🙏 Spiritual Practice

- ✅ 20 minutes praying in tongues
- ❌ Missed Bible reading
- ✅ Visualization / imagination session

### 🧠 Professional Work

- 8 hours at **MinoHealth AI Labs**
  - Continued multi-agent AI research
  - Further studied Anthropic’s Claude system & its planning structures

### 📉 Market Practice — Trend Trading

- Revisited **market structure trading** after Day 16’s frustration
- Entered **simulated trades** on TradingView (no real money)
  - Traded _with the trend_: structure, impulse, confirmation setups
  - Scored several **winning setups**
- Internal check:
  - Felt overhyped → Reminded self: _“Don’t be cocky. The market is KING.”_
  - Controlled emotions post-win. Practiced **emotional neutrality**.

### 💡 Insight

> Mastery is not in the win. It’s in how you act after it.  
> _“Whether win or loss — emotions must stay flat. Market = King.”_

## 🔁 Carryover to Day 18

- Continue with **Supply & Demand** technical analysis
- Journal fake-outs, entries, setups that felt clean vs. noisy
