# 🗓️ Day 004 — June 11, 2025

## ✅ What I Did

### 🙏 Spiritual Practice

- 20 min prayer in tongues
- Read 1 Bible chapter
- Imagination session

### 🤖 LLM Development

- Rebuilt simplified self-attention mechanism again to solidify intuition
- Relearned attention score computation
- Learned to compute attention weights:
  - Averaging
  - Naive softmax (noted limitations)
  - Proper softmax with max subtraction for numerical stability (PyTorch)
- Learned to compute context vectors for a single query using Python

## 💡 Key Insight

The path to real understanding is often _repetition with awareness_. Self-attention isn’t just a function—it’s a system of moving focus.

## 🔁 Next Steps

- Compute context vectors for multiple queries
- Generalize simplified self-attention module
