# 🧪 Pre-Challenge Log — Before 100 Days Began

## Overview

In the days leading up to this challenge, I went deep into foundational work for building my own LLM from scratch — not just to code a model, but to sharpen my thinking, creativity, and engineering resilience.

## ✅ What I Accomplished (3 Days Total)

### Day -3 to Day -1:

#### 🔢 Neural Networks

- Built artificial neural networks from scratch (revision)

#### 🧠 LLM Foundations

- Studied basics of large language models and their components
- Reviewed all stages of the LLM build process

#### 📚 Research Dive

- Read the original Transformer architecture paper
- Understood self-attention, encoder-decoder design, limitations

#### 🧬 Tokenization Pipeline

- Implemented basic word-level tokenizer from scratch
- Implemented Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for subword tokenization
- Built sliding window algorithm for input-target pair creation
- Integrated `PyTorch Dataset` and `DataLoader` API

#### 🔡 Embeddings + Positional Encoding

- Studied how LLMs learn embeddings
- Built static embedding vector models and positional encodings from scratch
- Integrated Google’s 100B-word word2vec model (300-dim vectors)

#### 🧹 Preprocessing Pipeline

- Designed and implemented a preprocessing system for 125M-token dataset:
  - Text cleaning
  - Tokenization (BPE)
  - Vectorization
  - Positional encoding
  - Input embeddings

## 💬 Summary

Before even beginning **Day 1**, I had already gone down multiple rabbit holes, rewired my understanding of transformers, and coded fundamental building blocks from scratch. This pre-log is not part of the official 100 days, but it’s proof that this journey began with deep conviction—not hype.
