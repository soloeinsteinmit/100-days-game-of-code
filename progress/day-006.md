# 🗓️ Day 006 — June 13, 2025

## 🕰️ Time Log

- Slept at 12:48 AM (after studying late from Day 5)
- Woke up at 5:06 AM

## ✅ What I Did

### 🧠 LLM Development

- Began learning how to build self-attention layers with **trainable weights**:
  - Learned the roles of **Queries, Keys, Values** (QKV) from a trainable perspective
  - Started implementing weight matrices for Q, K, V

### 💹 Algo Trading

- Studied **Forex trading fundamentals and psychology**:
  - Risk management mindset
  - Emotional discipline for algorithmic trading

### 👨🏾‍💻 Full-time Work

- 8 hours at MinoHealth AI Labs (Bio-AI agents)

### 🙏 Spiritual Practice

- ✅ 30+ mins praying in tongues
- ✅ Read Matthew 4–5 (2 chapters)
- ✅ Imagination session (vision casting + clarity meditation)

## 💡 Key Insight

The _architecture of attention_ begins internally—trainable weights in code, and rewiring in the soul.

## 🔁 Next Steps

- Implement QKV projections from scratch with PyTorch
- Simulate attention weights over real input
- Draft MLQ5 trading simulation logic (basic entry/exit)
