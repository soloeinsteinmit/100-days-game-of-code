# 🗓️ Day 001 — June 8, 2025

## ✅ What I Did

### 🧑‍💻 Ecclesia App Development

- 🚨 Realized architectural flaws in my original implementation
- 🧠 Refactored major parts of the codebase based on a new scalable architecture:
  - Reduced overuse of Redux Toolkit for local state
  - Adopted smart caching, localized state, and cleaner data flow
  - Moved toward modular, scalable design inspired by OS-level thinking
- 🛠 Customized the Lexical rich text editor for the Monthly Focus section

### 🧠 LLM Development

- 🔁 Rebuilt entire data preprocessing pipeline from scratch:
  - Text cleaning
  - Tokenization (BPE)
  - Vectorization
  - Positional encoding
  - Input embeddings

### 💪 Physical Discipline

- 🏋️ 60 Pull-ups — tough but done!

### 📖 Spiritual Practice

- [Pending Bible Chapter and Tongues — please confirm if done]

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Refactoring is not about cleaning code — it’s realigning with the system's **purpose** and **scale**.
- Even with a strong spiritual mission, technical foundations must match the vision.
- Pipeline repetition sharpens mastery, not just muscle memory.

## 🧠 Reflections

Yesterday felt like I was _deconstructing to rebuild_. What I thought was “progress” in Ecclesia was bloat. The lesson: **clarity always wins over cleverness**. I saw parallels in my spiritual walk — pruning is painful, but fruitful.

## 🚀 Next Focus

- Begin building the attention mechanism from scratch
- Finalize architectural skeleton for Ecclesia messaging system
