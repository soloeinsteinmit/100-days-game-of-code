# 🗓️ Day 007 — June 14, 2025

## 🕰️ Time Log

- Woke up at 5:00 AM feeling overworked and fatigued

## ✅ What I Did

### 💹 Forex Mindset

- Continued studying **Forex trading psychology**:
  - Resilience, FOMO, handling loss
  - **Negative emotion:** Fear, fraustration, anger, depression, stress
  - **Positive emotion:** Excitement, Joy, cockiness
    > I've got to learn to discipline myself for all these

### 💻 Side Project

- Returned to building the **Ecc...💎 App**
  - Modular work, feature extension (details private for now)

### 🙏 Spiritual Practice

- ❌ No prayer
- ❌ No Bible reading
- ❌ No imagination/visual session

## 💡 Key Insight

Overwork without spiritual and mental discipline is just _controlled burnout_. You can’t pour from an empty vessel.

## 🔁 Carry Over

- Missed Bible chapters → push to Day 9
- Reset morning routine
