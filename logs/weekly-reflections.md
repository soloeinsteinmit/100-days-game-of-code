# 📆 Weekly Reflections

## ✅ Week 1 — Foundation & Friction

- **⚙️ Built:** Word & subword tokenization (BPE), vector embeddings with positional encodings, simplified self-attention, foundational LLM pipeline

- **📚 Learned:** Transformer intuition, attention mechanics (Bahdanau, self-attention, context vectors), Forex psychology fundamentals

- **🧠 Practiced:** Matrix math for attention, PyTorch-based embedding and self-attention implementations

- **🙏 Spiritual Gains:** Clarity on discipline gaps → “Presence over pressure.” Prayer remained consistent even when routines broke

- **🔥 Challenge:** Balancing full-time AI lab work, app dev, and LLM studies without sacrificing rest or spiritual rhythm

- **👁️ Key Insight:** Discipline isn’t restriction—it’s infrastructure for breakthrough. Self-attention isn’t just a model trick; it’s a life principle.
