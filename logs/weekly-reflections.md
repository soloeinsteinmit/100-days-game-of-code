# 📆 Weekly Reflections

## ✅ Week 1 — Foundation & Friction

- **⚙️ Built:** Word & subword tokenization (BPE), vector embeddings with positional encodings, simplified self-attention, foundational LLM pipeline

- **📚 Learned:** Transformer intuition, attention mechanics (Bahdanau, self-attention, context vectors), Forex psychology fundamentals

- **🧠 Practiced:** Matrix math for attention, PyTorch-based embedding and self-attention implementations

- **🙏 Spiritual Gains:** Clarity on discipline gaps → “Presence over pressure.” Prayer remained consistent even when routines broke

- **🔥 Challenge:** Balancing full-time AI lab work, app dev, and LLM studies without sacrificing rest or spiritual rhythm

- **👁️ Key Insight:** Discipline isn’t restriction—it’s infrastructure for breakthrough. Self-attention isn’t just a model trick; it’s a life principle.

### ✅ **Week 2 — Discipline Under Pressure**

- 🧪 **Built**:

  - Fine-tuned multiple 7B models using Unsloth (including Qwen on medical datasets)
  - Launched the Ecc...💎 App waitlist landing page
  - Setup TradingView + internalized market structure theory

- 🧠 **Learned**:

  - Vision-Language Models + LoRA finetuning (for IndabaX)
  - Deep dive into Forex: Risk Management, Fundamental Analysis
  - Market structure: BoS, impulses, corrections, swing vs. sub-structures

- 🎤 **Presented**:

  - Gave a VLM workshop at IndabaX AI Ghana

- 🙏 **Gained**:

  - Strengthened spiritual routines: consistent prayer, visual sessions
  - Built awareness of body rhythms → now syncing 2–4 AM wakeups with higher energy windows

- 🧩 **Challenge**:

  - Fatigue hit hard: <5 hours sleep for 10+ days
  - Slippage in Bible reading, early signs of burnout
  - Need to refine planning blocks and protect energy windows

- 💡 **Key Insights**:

  - _Rest isn’t weakness—it’s wiring._
  - **Discipline under fatigue becomes identity.**
  - Trading, like code, reveals your biases. And both reward your patience.
