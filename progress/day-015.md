### 📉 Forex Study — Technical Analysis: Market Structure

- Set up **TradingView**
- Studied core technicals:
  - 3 Market structures: uptrend, downtrend, consolidation

  - Market reversals: Bullish ↔ Bearish transitions
- Key takeaway:
  - _Market = narrative of buyers vs sellers_
  - Think like a **player**, not a spectator

#### 🧠 Personal Market Notes — Solo Reflection

- “Every movement in the market is a human decision. Someone is moving money with intention—read that intention.”
- Zooming between timeframes reveals substructures that carry signals of institutional logic

  - Purpose: Build _mental toughness_, force system reset weekly
  - Action: To be enforced every Sunday going forward

## 💡 Key Insight

Mental clarity isn’t only won in prayer or code. Sometimes, it’s built one step at a time, in silence, on the road.
