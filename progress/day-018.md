### 📉 Market Practice — Supply & Demand

- Completed supply & demand lesson
- Attempted live structure spotting on market charts:
  - Misread multiple zones (anxious to find a move)
  - 3 out of 4 entries failed due to **rushed logic**
    - Pressure led to poor analysis
    - USD news likely shifted macro trend (e.g. U.S.–Iran tension)
  - One win: **USDJPY trade** followed correct analysis and succeeded
- 📌 Psychological Checkpoint:
  - Caught self forcing setups
  - Internal reset: _“NO PRESSURE. Market is KING. Patience = Power.”_

### 🎬 Documentation & Tools

- Switched daily video logs from **CapCut ➝ DaVinci Resolve 20**
  - Began learning Resolve 20 interface and workflow
  - Goal: raise storytelling quality + build long-term editing skill

## 💡 Key Insight

Your edge is never speed. It’s **timing + composure**.

> “You don’t trade for setups. You wait — and the setup trades you.”

## 🔁 Next Steps

- Begin practicing **confirmation stacking** before entering trades
- Continue DaVinci learning curve (shortcut + grading fundamentals)
- Journal emotional temperature before/after each trade
